-- Something with image effects

-- In simulator...
	-- Try to use node? (test existence in path... can check for installed modules?)
	-- Else, fire up a web page, pull an image (asked for beforehand?), getImageData(), pipe that in as JSON
-- Else
	-- Do the same as the simulator-else, in a web view?
	-- Otherwise, if available, use the pixel sampler

-- Given stream, go to town on the data!
-- Some effects are planned
