	Near / not-too-far future TODO list:

	- Finish off seams sample, including dealing with device-side problems (PARTIAL)
	- Do the colored corners sample (PARTIAL)

	- Proceed with editor, finally implement some things like the background view
	- Refine link system, make more linkables (FSM's? All those things I was making before...)
	- Editor-wise, generally just make everything prettier, cleaner
	- Improve custom widgets (Bitmap, Grid1D, Grid2D, Keyboard, Link, LinkGroup, etc.)
	- Make some dialogs to stress-test the section feature
	- Decouple dialogs from the editor
	- Decouple links / tags from editor? Instancing? (PROBATION)

	- Some sort of stuff for recurring UI tasks: save / load dialogs, listbox, etc. especially ones that recur outside the editor (PARTIAL)
	- Kill off redundant widgets (button, checkbox)

	- Play with input devices

	- Fix formatting, which is rather off on tablets and probably more high-definition phones

	- Make the resource system independent of Corona, then start using it more pervasively

	- Figure out if quaternions ARE working, if so promote them

	- ID-occupied array op module
	- Finally finish mesh ops / Delaunay
	- Finish up the dart-throwing stuff
	- Finish up the union-find-delete, some of those other data structures
	- Do a CMV or Poisson MVC sample?
	- Start something with geometric algebra, a la Lengyel
